<title>Powerunit Extensions Matchers</title>
</head>
<body>
	This is an extension to Powerunit to generate matchers for POJO.
	<p>This library provides several annotation processors :
	<ul>
		<li><b>Processing of the ProvideMatchers annotation.</b><br>This
			processor create <code>Matcher</code> for each annotated class, in
			the following way :
			<ul>
				<li>For public field, create a dedicated matcher, accessing
					this field by using direct access.</li>
				<li>For method named <i>getXXX</i>, which haven't any parameter
					and return something, assume this is a field and create a dedicated
					matcher, accessing it by using this method.
				</li>
				<li>For method named <i>isXXX</i>, which haven't any parameter
					and return something, assume this is a field and create a dedicated
					matcher, accessing it by using this method.
				</li>
				<li>If this class extends another one (outside <i>Object</i>),
					a special matcher will be created to check the super class
					information.
				</li>
				<li>Create one (or two if a super class exists) methods to
					build the matcher. These method are named based on the class name,
					followed by <i>with</i>.
				</li>
				<li>Create dedicated method to compare, using matcher, on
					object with another.</li>
				<li>For some specific type, add method to do some matching with
					more clean name, like XXXIsPresent for an Optional.</li>
				<li>If some library are available, add special matchers.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><b>Generating class with all the matchers, directly
				during annotation processing</b><br> <i>This processor requires
				to set the parameter <code>ch.powerunit.extensions.matchers.provideprocessor.ProvidesMatchersAnnotationsProcessor.factory</code>
				(<code>-A</code> parameter).
		</i><br>This processor create <code>DSL</code> interface for each
			factory method of the matchers, in the interface defined by this
			parameter.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>The annotation {@code javax.annotation.Generated} is not
		available OOTB with recent version of java. You may need to add a
		dependency providing it if necessary.</b>
	<p>
	<b>The hamcrest library is required by this annotation processor and the generated classes.</b>
